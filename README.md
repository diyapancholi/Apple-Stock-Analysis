# Apple-Stock-Analysis

- In this project, I performed a time series analysis on Appleâ€™s stock prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model.
- The dataset was sourced from Yahoo Finance and included daily closing prices.
- I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing trends, seasonality, and volatility. Stationarity was checked using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, and differencing was applied to make the series stationary.
- The optimal ARIMA parameters were selected using ACF/PACF plots and Grid Search (AIC/BIC criteria).
- The trained model was then used to forecast future stock prices, providing insights into potential trends.
